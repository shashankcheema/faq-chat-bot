To enhance our monitoring and alerting capabilities for the DNA organization's standalone Python models and scripts, we are requesting access to the Datadog API key. This request is essential for two primary reasons that directly contribute to our goals of improving system reliability and operational efficiency:

1. Advanced Metrics Monitoring for Standalone Models
Our current infrastructure, which executes standalone Python models/scripts as cron jobs in Open Container Platform (OCP), lacks the capability to monitor crucial metrics such as method execution times. This limitation hinders our ability to track performance accurately and to identify errors effectively, as we lack proper error codes or messages. This gap in our observability framework prevents us from establishing Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for these models. The integration of Open Telemetry with Datadog, facilitated by the API key, would enable us to publish these custom metrics, thereby enhancing our monitoring capabilities and ensuring our models meet the desired performance standards.

2. Automating Alerting Mechanisms
As part of our commitment to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles, we aim to ensure that all teams have robust alerting mechanisms in place. To achieve this, we plan to develop custom automation that will assess the current alerts set by various teams against a set of mandatory alerts recommended by our SRE team. This process will identify any discrepancies or missing alerts, allowing us to send notifications to the relevant teams and ensure that observability standards are uniformly maintained across the organization. This proactive approach will not only improve incident response times but also align all teams with best practices in monitoring and alerting.

Additional Information:
The acquisition of the Datadog API key is a strategic move to bridge significant gaps in our current observability and alerting framework. By enabling the publication of custom metrics through Open Telemetry and automating our alerting mechanisms, we can significantly enhance our ability to monitor, alert, and respond to issues across all applications and models within our purview. This initiative aligns with our broader goals of ensuring system reliability, operational efficiency, and a consistent observability framework across the organization. Approval of this request will empower the SRE team to implement these critical improvements, fostering a more resilient and efficient technological ecosystem.

We are prepared to present a detailed plan outlining the implementation strategy, expected outcomes, and how the Datadog API key will be securely managed, ensuring alignment with the organization's security policies and standards. Your support in granting this request will be instrumental in advancing our observability and reliability objectives.
