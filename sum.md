Current Integrations
Real-Time Models/Applications/Services:

Library Vulnerabilities: NexusIQ
Code Vulnerabilities: SonarQube
Container/Image Vulnerabilities: JFrog
Batch Models (Update):

Library Vulnerabilities: To be scanned with open-source tools as a supplement to NexusIQ.
Code Vulnerabilities: To be scanned with open-source tools as a supplement to SonarQube.
Container/Image Vulnerabilities: Directly available in JFrog, aligning with real-time models.
Proposed Solution for Batch Models
Objective
Extend and refine the vulnerability management process to include the newly containerized batch models, leveraging their availability in JFrog for container/image vulnerabilities alongside open-source tools for library and code vulnerabilities.

Solution Components
JFrog Integration for Container/Image Vulnerabilities:

Utilize JFrog Xray to scan batch model container images for vulnerabilities directly within JFrog, similar to the process for real-time models.
Automate the scanning process to trigger upon new image pushes to JFrog repositories.
Open-source Tool Selection for Library and Code Vulnerabilities:

Library Vulnerabilities: OWASP Dependency-Check alongside NexusIQ.
Code Vulnerabilities: Semgrep or Bandit for Python codebases, supplementing SonarQube.
CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement:

Integrate vulnerability scanning into CI/CD pipelines for both library/code and container/image vulnerabilities.
Automate the pulling of source code and container images for scanning during the build/deploy process.
Timelines and Dependencies
Weeks 1-2: Tool Selection and JFrog Setup

Finalize the selection of open-source tools for library and code scanning.
Configure JFrog Xray for automated scanning of batch model images.
Weeks 3-4: CI/CD Pipeline Integration

Integrate library and code vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline for batch models.
Ensure CI/CD pipeline is configured to trigger container/image vulnerability scanning in JFrog Xray upon new image pushes.
Weeks 5-6: Implementation and Testing

Roll out the updated vulnerability scanning process across batch models.
Conduct thorough testing to validate the effectiveness and coverage of the scanning processes.
Week 7 onwards: Monitoring, Documentation, and Iteration

Monitor the implementation for effectiveness and developer feedback.
Create comprehensive documentation for the updated vulnerability management process.
Iterate on the process and tooling based on real-world feedback and new security developments.
Potential Dependencies
Integration Complexity with Existing CI/CD Pipelines: Ensuring smooth integration without disrupting existing development workflows.
Tool Compatibility and Coverage: Verifying that selected open-source tools and JFrog Xray effectively cover the spectrum of potential vulnerabilities in both code and container images.
Access and Permissions: Managing secure access to JFrog for automated scanning processes, ensuring that CI/CD pipelines have appropriate permissions.
Risk Management
Comprehensive Coverage: Regular reviews to ensure all types of vulnerabilities are adequately detected across tools.
False Positives/Negatives: Establish a protocol for reviewing and addressing scan results to mitigate the impact of false positives/negatives.
Adaptability to New Threats: Stay updated on new vulnerabilities and adapt tool configurations and scanning processes accordingly.
