We're thrilled to announce two major enhancements introduced by our SRE Team that are now available for your use:

Logging SDK Enhancement: The kintsugi logger module now includes an enhanced decorator, designed to improve our logging capabilities significantly. This utility aids in determining execution times and categorizing error types more efficiently. For more details and usage instructions, please refer to the documentation here.

Batch Model Monitoring Dashboard: To provide deeper insights into the infrastructure side of batch models, we've developed a new monitoring dashboard. This tool is intended to enhance our understanding and monitoring capabilities. Access the dashboard and its documentation here.

We encourage everyone to explore these new capabilities and incorporate them into your projects. Your feedback is invaluable to us, so please share your experiences and suggestions for further improvements.

Best,
The SRE Team
