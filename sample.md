# Design Document for Birddog and Sidecar Flask Application Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the design and optimization of a new Flask application to be integrated as a sidecar container alongside the existing Birddog application running in OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). The goal is to extend Birddogâ€™s capabilities to handle monitors, alerts, and dashboards for applications that do not have a service listed in Datadog, using JSON or other request formats.

## Current State
Birddog is a Flask application running within a pod on OCP, providing automation for Datadog by allowing users to get, create, and update monitors, alerts, and dashboards. It relies on a specific YAML format and requires the application service to exist in Datadog, LeanIX, and ServiceNow. Datadog API keys are accessed through a Vault init container.

## Proposed Solution
Develop a new Flask application to run as a sidecar container alongside the Birddog application. This sidecar will utilize the Datadog API keys from the main Birddog container and handle requests for applications that are not listed in Datadog.

## Requirements
- **Communication:** Ensure seamless communication between the main Birddog container and the sidecar container.
- **Requests:** Requests will originate from the main Birddog container to the sidecar container.
- **OCP Configurations:** Configure OCP to ensure the Birddog container remains unaffected by the sidecar.
- **Changes to Main Container:** Document all necessary changes to the main Birddog container to support this integration.
- **Cons Remediation:** Address all potential disadvantages of the sidecar approach.

## Cons Remediation
- **Increased Complexity in Pod Management**: Implement automated deployment scripts to manage pod configurations and updates. Use Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets for managing configuration and sensitive data.
- **Potential Performance Overhead**: Optimize the sidecar container to use minimal resources. Conduct performance testing to identify bottlenecks and improve efficiency.
- **Robust Error Handling and Recovery**: Implement comprehensive error handling in the sidecar application. Use retry logic for transient errors and alerting mechanisms to notify about persistent issues.

## Detailed Plan

1. **Development Phase**:
   - Design the Flask application structure.
   - Implement API endpoints and Datadog client.
   - Write unit and integration tests.

2. **Configuration Phase**:
   - Define environment variables for inter-container communication.
   - Update OpenShift pod specifications to include the sidecar container.
   - Configure network policies for secure communication.

3. **Testing Phase**:
   - Conduct unit and integration testing.
   - Perform performance testing to ensure minimal resource usage and optimal efficiency.
   - Test inter-container communication and error handling mechanisms.

4. **Deployment Phase**:
   - Deploy the updated pod configuration to OpenShift.
   - Monitor the application for any issues.
   - Conduct post-deployment testing to ensure seamless operation.

## API Design

### Sidecar Flask Application API:
- **Endpoint:** /create_monitor
  - **Method:** POST
  - **Description:** Create a new Datadog monitor.
  - **Request Body:** JSON
  - **Response:** JSON

- **Endpoint:** /update_monitor
  - **Method:** PUT
  - **Description:** Update an existing Datadog monitor.
  - **Request Body:** JSON
  - **Response:** JSON

- **Endpoint:** /get_monitors
  - **Method:** GET
  - **Description:** Retrieve monitors.
  - **Response:** JSON

- **Endpoint:** /create_alert
  - **Method:** POST
  - **Description:** Create a new Datadog alert.
  - **Request Body:** JSON
  - **Response:** JSON

- **Endpoint:** /update_alert
  - **Method:** PUT
  - **Description:** Update an existing Datadog alert.
  - **Request Body:** JSON
  - **Response:** JSON

## Additional Technical Details

### Flask Application Structure
The new Flask application will follow a standard structure:

- **app/**: Directory containing the Flask application code.
  - **routes.py**: Defines the API endpoints and request handling.
  - **datadog_client.py**: Manages interactions with the Datadog API.
  - **utils.py**: Contains utility functions for request validation and error handling.
  - **config.py**: Configuration settings for the application, including environment variables.
- **tests/**: Directory for unit and integration tests.
  - **test_routes.py**: Tests for API endpoints.
  - **test_datadog_client.py**: Tests for Datadog client interactions.
  - **test_utils.py**: Tests for utility functions.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the Flask application.

### Inter-Container Communication
Inter-container communication will be facilitated through the following methods:

- **HTTP Requests**: The main Birddog container will communicate with the sidecar container using HTTP requests. Flask's built-in request handling will be used for this purpose.
- **Environment Variables**: Necessary environment variables for inter-container communication will be defined in the pod specification.

### Security Considerations
- **API Key Management**: The sidecar container will access Datadog API keys from the Vault init container, similar to the main Birddog container.
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS will be used for communication between the containers to ensure data security.

### Communication Flow:
1. Request initiated from Birddog container.
2. Birddog sends request to sidecar container.
3. Sidecar processes the request using Datadog API keys from Vault.
4. Sidecar sends response back to Birddog.
